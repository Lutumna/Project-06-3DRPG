# Project-06
For Project 6, I wanted to make a game with older PlayStation graphics. Since the older graphics fit horror well, I tried to create something with a gloomy atmosphere. I created a sewer system with longer paths and occasional tight corners to emulate elements of horde games, while still providing some uncertainty. The player will find themself in a dead end to start. Immediately they will encounter Larry, an old computer, who will bark orders at them on behalf of their employers. The player is tasked with clearing out the green creatures that infest the caves. The player is given a shotgun to force them into close encounters. Each kill earns $100 and some barrels have a chance of breaking for more money. When the player enters the mob radius they will disperse. The goal is to rack up as much money as possible and get out.
